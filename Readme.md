This is a hotel search website system, you can search the suitable rooms in different hotels, then check in online.
It has two parts, 
the first one is the room search website, it allows users to search the room they like then check in.
the second one is the hotel check in system, it allows the hotel managers to arrange the check in satuation.

I use SQL as Database, tomcat 7.0 as server, Java as the programme language, JSP to build to front pages and 
use MVC as the structure.

Warning: The system posted on Github contains most main codes, but you can not run it if you just download these files from
my Github, you still needs to add other jars, set up your server and DB, then you can run it. For details, you can contact
me via email: yangyang01011001@gmail.com

You can find all the JSP pages in directory: WebContent
You can find the main logic codes in directory: .../comp9321/logic and .../comp9321/jdbc
